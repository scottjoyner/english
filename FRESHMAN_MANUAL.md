# Freshman CSC NCSU Github Guide
This guide will go over the basic functionality of github starting with logging onto your new account through NC State. This github account is where the majority of your projects will be done in your programing classes. You are probably a CSC 116 or 216 student right now and github is the platform in which all of your projects progress can be stored, tracked, and saved.

1. Navigate to the login page for NCSU git
