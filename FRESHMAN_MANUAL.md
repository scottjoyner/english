If your task is strictly computer-based, you would have a list of equipment, including such items as any necessary software (including version) and the type of computer required (Mac, PC, Linux, etc.).
    The actual step-by-step directions, separated into tasks.
    Every step should:

        Be numbered
        Start with an action verb
        Have visual representation to ensure clarity
        Contain only a single action
        Steps should be separated into tasks, with a heading identifying the task and a short sentence identifying the importance and purpose of the task beneath the header.  See the video lecture for more information about this format.
    Troubleshooting section with answers to commonly asked questions or concerns in a Q-and-A format.
