# Project 2: Instructions
New students to NC State are tasked with getting set up in a variety of logistical areas, including registering for classes, creating their GitHub accounts for their classes, etc. As someone who’s been here at least for a little while, you know the ropes, so to speak. As part of a new orientation effort, you’ve been asked to write a set of instructions for a common activity that students need to do before or during their first semester on campus. You know that you have a wide variety of new students that you’re going to need to write to: the technically savvy and not, the new student and the transfer student, etc. One thing you do know is that this is an individual who has likely never done this activity before, and needs a lot of hand-holding throughout the process. You also know that if your instructions are not successful, and users encounter a lot of errors, they’re going to be calling the help desks a lot and your supervisor is not going to be happy.
## Audience Analysis 
My audience in this document is the incomming students to NC State who wish to learn computer science here at NC state think of it like a README.md file for incomming CSC students. I would like to lay out common problems and solutions that the freshman will run into. Furthermore I would like it to be a guide to understanding how to navigate their major and understand how important it can be to plan the right schedule. These students mostly will be knowledgeable about computers, but will likely be inable to operate a terminal, understand basic unix commands, or even know what a GUI is. These are all things that I will need to consider when writing my Instruction manual for freshman.
