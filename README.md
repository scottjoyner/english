New students to NC State are tasked with getting set up in a variety of logistical areas, including registering for classes, creating their GitHub accounts for their classes, etc. As someone who’s been here at least for a little while, you know the ropes, so to speak. As part of a new orientation effort, you’ve been asked to write a set of instructions for a common activity that students need to do before or during their first semester on campus. You know that you have a wide variety of new students that you’re going to need to write to: the technically savvy and not, the new student and the transfer student, etc. One thing you do know is that this is an individual who has likely never done this activity before, and needs a lot of hand-holding throughout the process. You also know that if your instructions are not successful, and users encounter a lot of errors, they’re going to be calling the help desks a lot and your supervisor is not going to be happy.
